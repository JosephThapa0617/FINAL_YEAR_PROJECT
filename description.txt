It contains 4 dof robot with environment setup 
here with alpha beta and position constraints the end effector of the robot is always parallel to the ground


Since the change of coordinates in ground level might knock down the other cups while the robot is moving from one coordinate to another
the operation is divided into two minor steps 

the first step is to go to the x,y coordinate of the desired location with z coordinate larger than the cup height let's suppose (H)
due to this the robot will hover over the cups without knocking them

After the x,y is fixed next comes the z coordinate adjustment so that the robot can hold the cups and move accordingly

Once the robot has grabbed the cup it lifts the cup with previous z coordinate i.e. H
